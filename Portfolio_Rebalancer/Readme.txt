This code is a simple backtest to study portfolio rebalancing vs buy and hold investment strategy.
A $1000 is being invested equally amoung 10 cryptos 500 days back and on a daily basis the bot checks current total portfolio balance and recalculate and balances their dollar amount equally.
so if 50% of the cryptos are in profit and other 50% are in loss the the profit is split among the crypto in such a manner at that time their dollar values will remain same.
